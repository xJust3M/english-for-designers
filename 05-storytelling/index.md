Hi! I’m Matty and I… chose a wrong highschool. Which, let’s be honest - most of us did. 

And the reason for that is simple, when we are young and someone asks us, what we wanna be when we group up, most kids have a clear answer. It might be not the most thought of answer the universe ever got to observe, but they have it. Right away.

Astronaut! Football player! President! Doctor! And here in Czechia it’s also trashman for whatever reason. Which I just recently learned is not a global thing.

Anyways, my point is that the answer is usually pretty straight forward. But once we grow up a little, we start to realize most of us can’t really be astronauts, presidents or make a living by playing football. And that being a doctor also probably isn’t for us. And the parents wouldn’t be super happy if our future was being a trashman. So then we have to start thinking over, what is it that I wanna do?
Some people actually do know what they enjoy to the point they want to do it. They go study, they finish their studies, they start working and to the end of their existence they are happily doing their dream job. 

But that’s not the case for most. Most people when they have to choose their highschool have no idea what they wanna do. If they are smart kids, they gonna be useless by studying gymnasium and if they are not so smart, they are gonna be useless by studying whatever craft they give no shit about. 

And then there is actually a 3rd group of people. People who think they know what they are curious about and want to do but slowly learn it’s actually not their thing and they don’t want to draw blood from screeching snotty kids. And this was exactly my case… Not with the blood drawing but you know.. 

I have already kinda explained my story in my introduction talk but I will briefly summarise and maybe add something new to it as it is crucial to this topic.

As a kid I didn’t have much friends. I still don’t. And what does a kid with no friends do in 21st century? He plays video games.
One of the reasons my parents didn’t send me to a psych ward for being addicted was that I not only cared about the games themselves but also other stuff. Everything was somewhat connected to the games but I also liked creating, editing photos, videos, everything connected to games. And overall I was curious about computers themselves.

So when choosing a highschool, it was pretty clear it’s gonna be something about computers. But what?

Somehow and to this day I don’t really understand how, I completely ignored the stuff I actually was doing, meaning editing all sorts of things and instead thought „Yes! I wanna know how everything works and how the games are made. Programming is the way!“

And the funny thing is, my childhood friend applied to a highschool that combined programming with hardware and I thought that’s not what I want. But actually it was what saved me, kinda. But about that later.

First year of highschool was all about convincing myself I actually do care about programming, but… that didn’t really work. Starting with 2nd grade, I realised it completely as two new subjects got introduced to us. It was hardware and basics of computer graphical design.
I was very good at graphical design basically from the beginning and when it comes to hardware, I wanted a new computer at that time. And I thought to myself I should also build it myself. So I started learning hardware from my own initiative and I really enjoyed it. Because of that, I was also good at school when it came to hardware. Actually, this is not supposed to sound egoistic but sometimes I felt like I know more about current technologies than our teacher did. I loved to argue with him about stuff, trying to show him I know more while still acting like I really respect what he will tell me.

Anyways, the longer I was there, the more I realized I simply care about everything but programming. 

Third grade was when everything changed as a new subject got introduced. It was an optional subject about 3D modeling. 
I signed for it and from the beginning, I liked it. I was curious about it. But I hated the program we had to use. Later on, I was recommended to try out Blender and I immediately fell in love with it. I started learning it by myself and shortly I it was very clear not only what my final project is going to be but also what I want to study next.

3 years later and I am finishing this school, freelancing as a 3D artist, motion graphics designer and video editor.  

However, although I completely changed my specialization, I am glad I studied what I did on higschool. Because although I am now in a creative field, I find it very benefical to know more in depth stuff about computers and computer hardware. 
Especially in 3D as 3D is of course creative thing but it also requires technical thinking often which I was able to develop thanks to my highschool. 

My highschool that I considered to be a mistake. 

Right now, I am in a similar situation. I am finishing my studies, working on final project and working at the same time. 
And you know what? I hate it. 

I hate that feeling of not doing anything at 100%.

I was thinking many times how wonderful it would be if I could already be either employed full time somewhere or work freelance carrier full time. 

But... Thanks to my previous experience I feel like I will be glad for this one day. For having the opportunity to finish my studies in peace, having enough time for my project, other interests and just being able to enjoy that "I can be curious about and touch anything I want" period.
I keep telling to myself "You can work for the rest of your life."

And that is my final word for this talk... Don't stress too much about whether the things you currently do are right for you or whether you're wasting your time with it. 
I am not saying that if you feel like you're doing something you're not passionate about that you shouldn't head a different way. But don't regret it as every experience is valuable and will give you something in the future.
