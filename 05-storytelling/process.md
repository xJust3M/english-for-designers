- Read [the article](…) <!-- index.md -->

## Process

**Topics I want to mention:**
- how difficult it is to choose the right one, how not everyone has the options, kids want to be trashmen, later on it's harder to tell
- how I was choosing highschool
- how I tried to convince myself I chose the right one for the first year
- how I then realized I really don't care about programming
- how at least hardware got my attention
- how I changed my specialization
- how I am now glad I didn't study art highschool (-> building a PC, having "back door", knowing what I am working with hardware-wise)
- how I know I'll feel the same in the future
- perhaps connect it to regreting/feeling this way about other things (gaming, summer jobs etc.)
- erasmus?
