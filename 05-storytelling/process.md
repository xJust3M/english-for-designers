## Process

**Topics I want to mention:**
- how difficult it is to choose the right one, how not everyone has the options
- how I was choosing highschool
- how I tried to convince myself I chose the right one for the first year
- how I then realized I really don't care about programming
- how at least hardware got my attention
- how I changed my specialization
