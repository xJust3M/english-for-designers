When I hear or read the word „influencer“ I feel like I am no longer able to understand the world around me. Which is crazy, as I am only 21 and I’ve always been a part of new trends and stuff. I myself spent 5 years by creating video content on YouTube. But here’s my hot take. I learned a lot by doing that. I felt the need to improve. I had my idols and my young me wanted to be like them. I started learning many different things. Editing, creating graphics,  and making my own motion graphics. Later on I invested into a better microphone to make my videos sound better. Because I felt the need to be compareble to those above me. But in the world of social media, it doesn’t work like this. Influencers are not trying to improve in any specific skillset. You know why? Because there is only one difference between a small and worldwide influencer superstar. And that difference is how bizzare and viral they can become. There are no production quality differences, nor content differences most of the time. It’s all a similar garbage. 

There isn't any creativity, any need to improve, any need to share something valuable. And valuable things don’t have to be educational. It can be entertainment that’s not dumb. And that combined with the word itself even makes me sad to some point. Why is influencer an influencer? Because he influences… and who? Mostly youth. How can I appreciate somebody who earns money by degenerating children? Whom we often call a „celebrity“ because he’s making a content with 0 value. Content filmed on a mobile selfie camera, knows shit about editing and has zero skill in anything? One might say… then why are they so popular? And to that I say, it’s a reflection of our modern society. It is what lots of people entertain themselves with today. And what do they see in it? I cannot understand that. Not even if somebody is trying to explain it to me. 

And as a little disclaimer. I am aware there is also plenty of creators that actually put some work, soul and value in their content. That didn’t build their career only by brainwashing children. But you know what’s funny? Those people often don’t want to be refered at as „influencers“.

I was filming one podcast recently. There were several people that are „full time influencers“. Some actually seemed pretty cool. But what I found funny and interesting was how these individuals with more than 50 braincells always threw that "Ahh, y-yeah.." face when they were introduced as influencers. When somebody introduced himself proudly as „I am an influencer“ I could tell right away that I’d die if I was about to talk with him about anything for 1 minute. 

Although we shouldn’t put everybody in the same box, one thing is clear.

Lot, and I mean a lot of influencers create bizzare content while being aware of it, because it works. And that’s my last point I would like to share. 

We as a society should think more about how we spend our time and who are we giving our time to. Time is a commodity. 

And lot’s of people are actually aware that lot’s of the mentioned content is a waste of time. And they are also confused why does it even exist.

But yet they still watch it and that way feed it.

The best thing we can do, if we feel like it shouldn’t be popular and discussed is to not care about it.
