[DBRAND's voice tone and style analysis](dbrand.md)

## Hi! I'm Matthew and this is my very serious attempt  to describe my also very serious voice and tone.

# Voice

DBRAND's voice is overall professional, yet down to Earth. They want to show its customers, they are normal humans that like humor and have personal relations to their partners.

1. **Professionality** - On one hand, they are very professional. They know what they are doing and it is obvious to the customer.
2. **Fun** - On the other hand however, they want to put the "fun" everywhere possible. Want to work with them? You will find no "Join us" button. You fill find a "I want a job" button. 
When shopping for a protective skin for Beats headphones - do you expect how they will be claiming how good value their skins are and how you surely want to protect your amazing and expensive headphones?
Nope. Their main text for this product is "Beats skins - Overpriced stickers for overpriced headphones." They have no problem with joking even about their prices.
3. **Partnerships** - Important part of DBRAND's image is how they treat people they partnered with. Probably the best example is one of the largest tech channels on YouTube - Linus Tech Tips. 
Some companies require specific things to be said by the partnered creator, some give more freedom. But only a few come close to how DBRAND and Linus work. They don't feel like the typical "This video is sponsored by...". They feel more like 2 friends trying to help each other while having a love-hate relationship. They often make fun of each other, trashtalk each other and people love it.

# Tone

DBRAND's tone changes based on who they are talking to. But overall they assume you chose them mainly because of their voice and brand image.
