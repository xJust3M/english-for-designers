# Voice, Tone, and Style

## Hi! I'm Matthew and welcome to my very serious attempt to describe my also very serious voice and tone.

### Voice

As you can probably already tell from my introduction sentence, my voice is characteristic by being humorous or even sarcastic. It of course heavily depends on who I am talking to, as I also tend to be direct and search for the solution as quickly as possible. If there is an opportunity to joke about something along the way, I usually don't miss it however.

I would breakdown my voice like this:

1. My voice is focused on the task, it is direct.
2. I am confident about what I know I can do.
3. I am polite and self-reflected, I don't want to sound like I know everythig.
4. I am speaking the way it is clear I know what I am talking about but I also make sure everybody understands me.

### Tone

**1. Lightweighted**
- When talking to someone who isn't sure about our possibilities or that it is possible to do something. When I know it is possible, I try to make it seem like it's a primitive thing and world doesn't spin around it. It usually helps everyone to calm down.

**2. Authoritative**
- When I am talking about something I know about more than others in the room, I take a stance where I am direct and say specifically how we can do it and what do we need for it.

**3. Professional**
- When I meet someone I should be working with for the first time, my main goal is to sound professional. Now jokes go aside, I want to show that I know what I am doing, why do I know it and how can I solve the overall problem.

**4. Friendly**
- Once everything settles down a bit, I start to show more of my fun side. I like to joke about things I am doing, telling little stories about my experiences with things we are currently working at and overall trying to make the atmosphere lighter.
