## Introduction
### Greetings! The name I was given when I appeared in this world is Matyáš Letáček.
I'm a passionate, creative person that finds his joy in creating eye pleasing, functional multimedia products.
Whether that's 2D motion graphics, 3D animations, VFX shots or even edited spots!

## About me
My journey begins at around age of 3. Too soon? No, I mean it! It's because when I was 3, my passion for videogames first showed up when I was playing original MS DOS version of Prince of Persia with my dad before my bedtime.
Thankfully, I was not just playing video games. I was also curious about how they are actually made. 

So, when I was choosing my highschool it seemed very clear. Programming! That's surely the way. 
I went and studied SPŠE in Pardubice, specialization "IT - Programming and hardware". During the first year, I was really unsure about my future. Because I was trying to force myself to liking programming. 

But when I started noticing that I care more about how my calculator looks, instead of whether it even functions, I realized I went to wrong doors. I realized that what I was always curious about was not how are games made from the logical aspect. It was how are they made graphic-wise. 
And it makes sense as I was playing with Photoshop and video editing tools since ago of 11. You know how many times I tried to program something? Exactly... Never.
But I thought that if you want to study graphical design, or some creative field, you must be able to draw. Which is nonsense. 

For my whole highschool, I was also creating shorter, gaming related videos, which as you can tell also kinda went against my "programmer" future.

Either way, 2nd year introduced hardware, which I enjoyed and still enjoy. So If I'm making some video editing for you and you suddenly need to build a new computer, I can do that.

Third year is when the turning point came however. Because we got to choose between two optional subjects. "Network security" or "Multimedia". 
Since Network security sounded scary, I picked multimedia in which we were working with 3D graphics. After a while I fell in love with it. I knew that this is what my final highschool project will be about and what I want to study next.

So now I am here, in the final grade of VŠKK, specialization "Animations and visual effects", working in my field alongside my studes and I love it. 

## Some of my work
Shortly after I started my first real job, I was asked whether I'm able to do some liquid simulations. That they might have something for **Pepsi** for me.
I said yes! I don't have many experiences with liquid simulations but I'll do my best.
And it turned out great I think. Pepsi is doing this for some years now, meaning I have something to compare my result to and I am happy with it. You can check the full ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHiboX409VY&pp=ygUNcGVwc2kgcmVrbGFtYQ%3D%3D). I also made the motion graphics btw.
It was broadcasted in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Malta (guess Malta is a big Pepsi enjoyer). 
In TV, YouTube, cinemas, you name it.

This was 1,5 years ago so let's take a look at something more recent.

**Chromozoom** is a company that's offering DNA tests to make you understand your body more. I composited [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4510LKV5iiI&pp=ygUKY2hyb21vem9vbQ%3D%3D) ad for them. Every time stopping scene, all the infographics and packshot. I'm currently working on a CLV spot for them. (That's the type of ad you see in metro.)

There is also a very cool currently ongoing project for Czech company Shoptet, which is a tool to help you build your eshop. It's not released yet, so this is all I can show you lol sorry.

Besides all this surely very cool work stuff, In my personal life, I'm still a passionate gamer *(although not as I used to be, anybody knows how many goats I have to sacrifice to get 30 hours long days?)*
I also enjoy working out a bit *(don't call me a gymrat)*, watching anime *(don't call me weeb)* and reading mangas but I prefer physical form and they're freakin expensive *~~(don't call me poor)~~*.

When it comes to sports, I prefer single user gameplay sports. Like skiing, biking, snowboarding. Perhaps sports for two. 
To put it simply, I don't like sports where I have to function in a team. However, when it comes to videogames or job, I like to cooperate with others.

And that's it. Thank you for your time!
