# Year in review

I'd like to start of this year in review by saying that I planed on writing this much earlier. When I first read the assignment, I thought to myself "Finally, this is a year that was actually amazing and I can be positive when writing about it. This time, I can be the happy one."

But then, my castle of happiness started collapsing. The reason I was this happy started collapsing. And trust me, during that time, the last thing I wanted to do was writing about how I am doing or how I was doing. 

I apologize myself for the fact that I will not be very specific in this writing, but since it's still kinda a current thing, I don't feel comfortable doing so. I haven't even told the details to parents yet, although I am normally telling them everything.

Anyways, what I can tell you is that it was and still is a relationship issue. Last year in September, I met the most beautiful girl I know and got a chance to experience the relationship I've always wished for. Unfortunately, due to my previous relationships being pretty tragic and me realizing I'm being affected by them too late, I did many mistakes. Some more minor, some more significant. 

It's a paradox. When a person experiences bad relationship, they wish for a beautiful relationship with someone they would live and the other person would love them back. But at the same time, you always bring something inside you from those bad relationships. And if you are not super careful, they will affect your new relationship. Even when you think you left your past behind you. It might get you and endanger or even completely destroy the new relationship you always wished for. The relationship that has the potentioal to be finally beautiful.

I was happy, very happy about my life thanks to this relationship. Not noticing the other person is not. When looking back at it, I don't understand myself. If I could travel back in time, I'd prolly slap myself and tell my few months younger me to open his damn eyes and realize some things. When having these thoughts, self-hatred is not an uncommon thing, but I don't want to fall into this. I don't want to hate myself, I still want to have faith in myself and believe I can get better.

Things were going downward spiral gradually, but I just couldn't fully realize my mistakes until a recent event. Everything seemed fine during that time. I bought myself a new PC I planned on building. But when building it, I accidentaly broke a $340 motherboard. When taking it to a repairshop, I was really stressed it also took down the $500 CPU with it or something. I was extremely stressed about it. 
But I had no idea it's literally nothing to what was yet to come. Our relationship got to a critical point as I did the most stupid thing a person can do in a relationship. 

I lied. Hiding the fact I met someone.

And the worst thing? I had no reason to do so. I had no evil intentions, I had no thoughts of cheating or anything like that. So... what was the reason?

A fear. A strong fear I grew in previous relationships. A fear of not being understood and that I would make the other person sad. That she'd be mad at me although I did nothing wrong and I'd feel terrible. But why? Why does that happen when you **know** your current relationship is not like that. That your girlfriend is actually normal and nice. She even said she doesn't mind if I meet that person. Then why did I have the need to hide it? As I previously said, there are things I am absolutely not able to understand when looking back at it. And this one is by far the biggest one.

Our relationship was almost certain to end. But it didn't, she decided to continue and I decided to change. Change in all the things I didn't like about myself. Not just for our relationship. But for me overall.
I've never been so determined to change. I will do it, I will make things right. I know I can do it.
