# Year in review

I'd like to start of this year in review by saying that I planed on writing this much earlier. When I first read the assignment, I thought to myself "Finally, this is a year that was actually amazing and I can be positive when writing about it. This time, I can the happy one."

But then, my castle of happiness started collapsing. The reason I was this happy started collapsing. And trust me, during that time, the last thing I'd wanted to do was writing about how I am doing or how I was doing. 

I apologize myself for the fact that I will not be very specific in this writing, but since it's still kinda a current thing, I don't feel comfortable doing so. I haven't even told the details to parents yet, although I am normally telling them everything.

Anyways, what I can tell you is that it was and still is a relationship issue. Last year in September, I met the most beautiful girl I know
