My proud work

## Introduction
### Greetings! The name I was given when I first appeared in this world is Matyáš Letáček.
I'm a passionate, creative person that finds his joy in creating eye pleasing, functional multimedia products.
Whether that's 2D motion graphics, 3D animations, VFX shots or even edited spots!

## About me
My journey begins at around age of 3. Too soon? No, I mean it! It's because when I was 3, my passion for videogames first showed up when I was playing original MS DOS version of Prince of Persia with my dad before my bedtime.
Thankfully, I was not just playing video games. I was also curious about how they are actually made. 

So, when I was choosing my highschool it seemed very clear. Programming! That's surely the way. 
I went and studied SPŠE in Pardubice, specialization "IT - Programming and hardware". During the first year, I was really unsure about my future. Because I was trying to force myself to liking programming. 

But when I started noticing that I care more about how my calculator looks, instead of whether it even functions, I realized I went to wrong doors. I realized that what I was always curious about was not how are games made from the logical aspect. It was how are they made graphic-wise. 
And it makes sense as I was playing with Photoshop and video editing tools since ago of 11. You know how many times I tried to program something? Exactly... Never.
But I thought that if you want to study graphical design, or some creative field, you must be able to draw. Which is nonsense. 

For my whole highschool, I was also creating shorter, gaming related videos, which as you can tell also kinda went against my "programmer" future.

Either way, 2nd year introduced hardware, which I enjoyed and still enjoy. So If I'm making some video editing for you and you suddenly need to build a new computer, I can do that.

Third year is when the turning point came however. Because we got to choose between two optional subjects. "Network security" or "Multimedia". 
Since Network security sounded scary, I picked multimedia in which we were working with 3D graphics. After a while I fell in love with it. I knew that this is what my final highschool project will be about and what I want to study next.

So now I am here, in the final grade of VŠKK, specialization "Animations and visual effects", working in my field alongside my studes and I love it.
